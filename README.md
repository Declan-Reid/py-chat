# Python Chat (Server and Client)
An awesome way to chat with your friends (especially when discord, snapchat, etc is blocked)

## What's in the (virtual) box?
This work of art is a server and a client. One person hosts the chat server, and any client can simply join using the ip and port.

## How can I use it?
<p><b>Ensure you have python3 installed.</b></p>
<p>Head to the <a href="https://github.com/Declan-Reid/py-chat/releases" style="color: dodgerblue;">releases</a> page and download the latest version (any version will work, but the latest is more stable).</p>
<p>Once you have the zip file downloaded, unzip it and run the server file contained with a terminal session. It should look something a little like:</p>
<code>$ python3 {file path (e.g. ~/Desktop/Server.py)}</code>
<p>After this, hand the 'Client.py' (or any extras) out to your friends. Everybody (including you) can join with the following:</p>
<code>$ python3 {file path (e.g. ~/Desktop/Client.py)}</code>
<p><i>Input IP, port and Name</i></p>
<p>Now chat away!</p>
